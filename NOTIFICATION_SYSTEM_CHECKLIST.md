## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues:

1. **"FCM token not received"**
   - âœ… Check Firebase configuration files
   - âœ… Verify app permissions
   - âœ… Test on real device (not emulator)
   - âœ… Check network connectivity

2. **"Notifications not sending from backend"**
   - âœ… Verify Firebase credentials
   - âœ… Check queue worker is running
   - âœ… Monitor Laravel logs
   - âœ… Test FCM server key validity

3. **"Background notifications not working"**
   - âœ… Implement background message handler
   - âœ… Test with app killed/background
   - âœ… Check device battery optimization
   - âœ… Verify notification channel setup

4. **"Topic subscription fails"**
   - âœ… Check topic naming convention (a-zA-Z0-9-_.)
   - âœ… Verify user authentication
   - âœ… Check Firebase project permissions

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Backend debugging
php artisan queue:work --verbose
php artisan queue:failed
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log

# Flutter debugging  
flutter logs
flutter run --verbose

# Test notification manually
php artisan tinker
> $driver = App\Models\Driver::find(1);
> $order = App\Models\Order::find(1);
> $driver->notify(new App\Notifications\WaitForDriverConfirmation($order));
```

## ðŸ“‹ QUICK VALIDATION SCRIPT

Run this to validate your setup:

```bash
# 1. Check Laravel environment
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache

# 2. Test database connection
php artisan migrate:status

# 3. Test queue system
php artisan queue:work --once

# 4. Run notification flow test
php test_notification_flow.php

# 5. Check Firebase connectivity
php artisan tinker
> app('firebase.messaging')->send([]);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your notification system is working correctly when:

- [ ] âœ… Users can register FCM tokens via API
- [ ] âœ… Drivers can register FCM tokens via API  
- [ ] âœ… Order creation automatically notifies nearby drivers
- [ ] âœ… Driver responses trigger user notifications
- [ ] âœ… All notifications appear on mobile devices
- [ ] âœ… Notification taps navigate to correct screens
- [ ] âœ… Background/foreground notifications both work
- [ ] âœ… Failed notifications are logged and retryable
- [ ] âœ… System handles token refresh automatically
- [ ] âœ… Performance is acceptable under load
